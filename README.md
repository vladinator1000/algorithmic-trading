# Algorithmic trading
I compared different methods of doing algorithmic trading using the [Huge Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs) from Kaggle. Here are my findings:

1. The linear model has the highest profit
2. ARIMA and Holt-Winters are better suited for short-term predictions.
3. The neural net models seem to fall somewhere in-between, but this can be improved with more data
